### The transmitter won't turn on, just flashing lights

**Q:** After charging the RadioMaster Boxer, the transmitter only flashes the 6 (orange) lights when the power button is pressed and held, and does not turn on. Unplugging the battery and SD card, and ensuring all switches are in the correct position, does not resolve the issue. What could be causing this?

**A:** You need to remove the back cover of the radio to access the internal battery. There are 4 screws - two at the top and two under the rubber grips at the sides. You can then remove the back cover (there are no wires between the back and front so it's safe to remove it completely). Check the internal battery connection and reseat it. Additionally, try removing the internal battery completely for about 10 minutes, then reconnect itâ€”this can help reset the system.
